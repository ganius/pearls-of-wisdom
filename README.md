# pearls-of-wisdom
A collection of personal notes from books, articles and videos. These notes are not necessarily a summary of these sources, rather they are a collection of insights, lessons and principles that are applicable universally.

Notes contain a link to the source wherever possible. Additional metadata is provided in a machine-readable format in case I want to build an app/website around these notes in the future. Hence, why I decided to put these in a GitHub repo rather than a note application.
